Now that we know there is a dev copy of the website running on the personal PC.. 

We also know that uses the git server to control his projects. We can try to check the git repo and see if we can find any clues.

we can evil-winrm into the git server and find the git repo here:

`c:\gitstack\repositories\website.git`

We can navigate to the repositories  directory and use `Download website.git` to save the repo to our attack box
