after trying a few commands we can see we are limited to a restricted shell (rbash)

we can see this by running `ps`

I can actually cat the `user.txt` flag with `tac` command

`tac user.txt`
`209333652507f89d0d3a41ff4070c081`

---

the `man` command is available and we can use this to break out
`man man`
`!bash`
