There are two primary types of evasion
- On-Disk evasion
- In-Memory evasion

In-memory evasion is hindered by AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) which scans scripts as they enter memory.

There are generally two categories for detection
- Static Detection
- Dynamic / Heauristic / Behavioural Detection

Modern AV relies on a combo of these


**Static Detection**
Static detection involes some type of signature detection. Ex: taking the hashsum of a suspicious file and looking up in DB.
